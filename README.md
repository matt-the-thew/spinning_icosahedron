# Rendering Geometry in-browser using Three.js
Sets up a simple scene using the Three.js library, and then renders that scene in a `<canvas>` tag that is appended to the html document.

Instantiates the included `IcosahedronGeometry` class, and uses the lil-gui library to create a simple GUI to edit environment variables.
